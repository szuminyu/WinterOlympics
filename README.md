# project1_winter_olympics
This is an individual project/assignment from the Data Visualization(DS-GA3001-015, NYU). This project can demonstrate my experiences in using tidyverse and ggplot2. It is about Winter Olympics, and we are required to crunch and visualize the data.

Winter Olympics Medals over Time

Q1: Medal Counts over Time: The first question asked students to count medals from Winter Olympics over time. Therefore, I plotted five countries and their total medal counts. Also, since U.K. don't participate in the Winter Olympics, I plotted the fifth graph with France. Here is the resource: Best Countries, Power (2018) U.S. News. https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/power-rankings

Q2: Medal Counts adjusted by Population, GDP: I calculated the rank from the total number of the gold medal and listed top 10 countries. Also, I adjusted their ranks in log population and GDP in the other two plots.

Q3: Host Country Advantage: I plotted ten host countries and their performances while they were hosting or just participating.

Q4: Country success by sport/ discipline/event: I selected to plot the United States and its performances in skating. So there are three categories of skating. Also, I added a line to show the performance of these three subgroups. Apparently, Short Track Speedskating performed quite well and owned the sharpest slope.

Q5: Most successful athletes: This plot is about the top athletes in skating. The standard of grading was that gold medals equaled to 3 points, silver to 2, and bronze to one. Also, the legend showed the country that athlete came from.

Q6: Make two plots interactive: I made plots from the question two and three interactive.

Q7: Data Table: I made the data table from the question three.
